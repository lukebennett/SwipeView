Additions to cubiq's version
============================

 * the proprietary transition code for webkit has been extended to cover other browsers supporting them as well.
 * the carousel now also has a property onClick that will be fired when the control is touched, but no distance is traveled.

Usage:
    
	carousel.onClick( function() {
		alert( "clicked!" );
	}Â );
